# README
These are the files for 2021 Fantasy Football Developer Kit.

If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, no problem. Just click the `Source
code` link under the latest release to download the files.  This will download
a file called `fantasy-sdk-2021-vX.X.X.zip`, where X.X.X is the latest
version number (v0.0.1 in the screenshot above).

When you unzip these (note in the book I've dropped the version number and
renamed the directory just `fantasy-sdk-2021`, which you can do too) make note
of where you put them.

For example, on my mac, I have them in my home directory:

`/Users/nathanbraun/fantasy-sdk-2021`

If I were using Windows, it might look like this:

`C:\Users\nathanbraun\fantasy-sdk-2021`

To use these projects, you need to have an ini file called `config.ini`. I've
included an example (`config_example.ini`) for you to use as a starting point.

So the first step is renaming `config_example.ini` to just `config.ini`. Then
you can paste your developer kit license key in it. More details in the PDF
guide.

## Updates & Roadmap
Normally, this would have been out earlier in August, however my wife was
diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma (good prognosis) a few weeks ago. That +
pulling our three kids 5 and under out of school (so they don't get her sick)
has made me crunched for time.

So, while I'm exited about this guide and happy with where it's at, I'm
also releasing it without a few features I wanted to include. However, there
WILL be updates, many in the next few days.

Here are my priorities, most important first:

### Priorities
- any bug fixes etc that people notice associated with this guide or the
  simulations API; definitely email me â€” [nate@nathanbraun.com](mailto:nate@nathanbraun.com)
- sleeper integration (hopefully very soon)
- Fantasy Math web access (ditto)
- a few simulation API convienence improvements
- typos, clarity etc

Check back here for updated versions. Will keep the changelog updated.
