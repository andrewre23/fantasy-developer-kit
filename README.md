# 2022 Fantasy Football Developer Kit
## What This Is
These are the files for 2022 Fantasy Football Developer Kit.

The Fantasy Football Kit is a follow up

## Installing
If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, no problem. Just click the `Source
code` link under the latest release to download the files.  This will download
a file called `fantasy-developer-kit-vX.X.X.zip`, where X.X.X is the latest version
number.

When you unzip these (note in the book I've dropped the version number and
renamed the directory just `fantasy-developer-kit`, which you can do too) make
note of where you put them.

For example, on my mac, I have them in my home directory:

`/Users/nathanbraun/fantasy-developer-kit`

If I were using Windows, it might look like this:

`C:\Users\nathanbraun\fantasy-developer-kit`

To use these projects, you need to have an ini file called `config.ini`. I've
included an example (`config_example.ini`) for you to use as a starting point.

So the first step is renaming `config_example.ini` to just `config.ini`. Then
you can paste your developer kit license key in it. More details in the PDF
guide.

## Changelog
### v0.5.4 and v0.5.5 (2021-10-15)
Remove some misc, unsed imports and fix a few variable references.

### v0.5.3 (2021-10-05)
Bugfix related to the moving the wdis module.

### v0.5.2 (2021-10-04)
Moved the final, auto wdis league integration from
`./projects/integration/wdis_auto_final.py` to `./wdis.py`. Renamed the old
manual version of `./wdis.py` to `./wdis_manual.py`.

### v0.5.1 (2021-10-04)
Minor bugfix to fleaflicker integration code.

### v0.5.0 (2021-09-21)
Added sleeper integration. Like other platforms, uses a snapshot of saved data
that's included here. Should make it easier to follow along.

### v0.4.0 (2021-09-17)
The automatic WDIS and league analysis projects now use a snapshot of saved
data (that I've included in this repository) to make it easier to run through
it and see what I'm seeing.

### v0.3.0 (2021-09-17)
Bugfix - `get_players` utility function now returns ESPN, Yahoo, and Sleeper
IDs.

### v0.2.0 (2021-09-14)
Now includes 2021 Fantasy Math web access. Added instructions for accessing in
book. Basically need to enter you license key at https://fantasymath.com/book

### v0.1.0 (2021-09-13)
Update league integration functions to get midweek points.

E.g. if you were running a WDIS analysis on the Friday after week 1, and your
opponent was starting Gronk, it'd be good to take into account the fact he
scored 29 PPR points the night before. Functions now do that.

Related: saved some snapshots of raw data for the walk throughs to make it
easier to follow along.

### v0.0.4 (2021-09-09)
Make it clearer license keys go in config.ini, not utilities.py. Drop version
numbers from code docstrings â€” too hard to manually keep up to date.

### v0.0.3 (2021-09-09)
Fix a bug in `./projects/integration/auto_wdis_final`

### v0.0.1 (2021-09-09)
Release!
