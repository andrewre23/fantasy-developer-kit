# 2022 Fantasy Football Developer Kit
These are the files for 2022 Fantasy Football Developer Kit. If you're reading
this and you *haven't* bought the 2022 kit yet, you can get it at
[https://fantasycoding.com](https://fantasycoding.com).

If you have, let's get started.  See installation instructions and then pick
back up in the guide.

## Installing
If you're not familiar with Git or GitHub, no problem. Just click the `Source
code` link under the latest release to download the files.  This will download
a file called `fantasy-developer-kit-vX.X.X.zip`, where X.X.X is the latest version
number.

When you unzip these (note in the book I've dropped the version number and
renamed the directory just `fantasy-developer-kit`, which you can do too) make
note of where you put them.

For example, on my mac, I have them in my home directory:

`/Users/nathanbraun/fantasy-developer-kit`

If I were using Windows, it might look like this:

`C:\Users\nathanbraun\fantasy-developer-kit`

To use these projects, you need to have an ini file called `config.ini`. I've
included an example (`config_example.ini`) for you to use as a starting point.

So the first step is renaming `config_example.ini` to just `config.ini`. Then
you can paste your developer kit license key in it. More details in the PDF
guide.

## Changelog
### v0.7.0 
First project is live. Updated `intro.py` to use (optional) snapshot of data.

### v0.6.0 
Initial 2022 version. Includes through an introduction to the data. Projects
coming soon.
